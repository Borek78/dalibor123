          Twenty years ago there was a student of Economics who was not happy
          with his studies. He wanted to do something more technical. He even
          went to visit his friend´s father and asked him questions about his
          programming job. Eventualy life made him finish his studies in
          economics.

          That student was me. My name is<span> Dalibor Pavlik </span> and I am
          an amateur <span>React Developer. </span> Presently I am looking for
          my first job.

          During my <Link to="/journey">coding journey</Link>, I created many
          projects. But the last one – the Fruits and Vegetables e-shop – stands
          out. I consider it to be my porfolio page flagship. I have created it
          to show that I am capable of creating something more complex than just
          a blog or a portfolio page.

        <p>
          I think that my potentional employers might want to know more about
          the person that created this website. Therefore, I decided to create
          the following video. It just shows how I speak. I do not thing that
          the content is special in any way. It is just something that I am
          comfortable to talk about.

            t-statistics. I should be able to refresh these skill very quickly.
