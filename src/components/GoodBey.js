            You have successfully placed an order in my experimental Fruits and
            Vegetables e-shop. I have created it to show that I know enough
            React, Redux, and Javacript to create a project that is a little bit
            more complex than a blog or porfolio page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally I just wanted to learn Redux. The freeCodeCampÂ´s video{" "}
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrs7u6bdbUw">
              Redux Tutorial - Beginner to Advanced
            </a>{" "}
            looked like a good tutorial. I was coding along the video and when I
            was finished with it, I realized I had enough tools to create an
            e-shop. That is how the Fruits and Vegetables e-shop came to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also created two videos. They will walk you through all the
            functionality of the e-shop. The sound is not very good but you
            should understand what I say. And that is it. I hope you like the
            e-shop and the videos.
          </p>

            P.S. The code of the e-shop is available on my GitHub. The name of
            the repo is{" "}
            <a href=" https://github.com/Borek78/fruits-and-vegetables">
