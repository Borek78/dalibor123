            <h2>HOW IT STARTED </h2>
            <p>
              I am a Buddhist enthusiast and, at the beginning, I created a few
              websites for my Buddhist activities.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="http://www.dharmazdarma.cz">Dharmazdarma.cz</a>
              </li>
              <li>Pandita.cz (first version) - it is not live</li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://borek78.github.io/how-to-create-pandita/">
                  How to create Pandita
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="http://www.pandita.cz">Pandita.cz (second version)</a>{" "}
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span>Dharmazdarma.cz </span>is a simple website that I created in
              2015 for my Buddhist publishing project.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Pandita.cz (first version)</span> was a website I created in
              2020 for my second Buddhist project. I made it with Wordpress.
              Later I replaced it with the second version and it is not live
              anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>How to create Pandita</span> is a blog that I created for my
              Pandita project. I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>{" "}
              for this project. Jekyll is a popular static site generator.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Pandita.cz (second version)</span> is, as you can imagine,
              the second version of my Pandita.cz website. For this project I
              used <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> - the fastest static
              site generator. I did not want to use Jekyll for this project
              because Jekyll installation (all the Ruby Gems) can be tricky and
              the build time can be very long for larger websites.

            <h2>LEARNING JAVASCRIPT </h2>
            <p>
              My favourite method of learning was to follow other people
              creating a project. I worked with these two projects:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://rock-paper-scissors-dev-ed.netlify.app/">
                  Rock Paper Scissors
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://codepen.io/dcode-software/pen/KYYKxP">
                  Virtual Keyboard
                </a>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span>Rock Paper Scissors</span> is a Javascript tutorial
              available on{" "}
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWPtKtYEsN4&t=1s">
                Dev Ed´s YouTube channel.
              </a>{" "}
              It was the first project I used for my learning. I was coding
              along and used resources like{" "}
              <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a> to reasearch
              the syntax. When I was finished with it, I created (copied) the
              project again, and again … until I was able to create the project
              by myself. A that became my learning method.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Virtual Keyboard</span> is a Javascript tutorial available
              on{" "}

              </a>{" "}
              It is a difficult project but it introduced me to a few chalenging
              concepts: the keyword THIS, document fragment, functions as object
              property and Object Oriented Programming (OOP). At this piont I
              felt confident with Javascript and I decided to learn React.
            </p>
            <div className="red-box"> </div>
            <h2>LEARNING REACT </h2>
            <p>
              To learn React, I used the following three projects. The last link
              is my customized version of the contact manager.{" "}

              Youtube channel. This was my first React project and I had to
              reasearch the syntax a lot. Especially the React hooks were very
              challenging to learn.

              Youtube channel. It introduced me to React Router and some of the
              related hooks like useNavigate. But the most challenging part here
              was the passing of properties and data between components.
            </p>
            <p>
              I noticed a few shortcomings in the original code and I decided to
              remove them. In the video below I talk about how I have improved
              the original project.

              thorough introduction to Redux and Redux Toolkit. I used it as a
              basis for my Fruits and Vegetables e-shop.

            <div className="red-box"> </div>
            <h2>My React Projects </h2>{" "}
            <p>I have created these two React projects:</p>

            <p>
              <span>Fruits and vegetables e-shop</span> is my first React
              project. When I finished the{" "}
              <a href="d">Redux for Beginners to Advanced tutorial</a>, I wanted
              to challenge myself. I wanted to show that I am able to create a
              project that is more complex than a blog or simple website. And
              therefore, I decided to create an e-shop.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have restyled the Redux tutorial page and thus created the first
              (products) page of the e-shop. The rest of the e-shop is my work
              only.
            </p>

              <span>Dalibor´s - my porfolio page</span> is the last React
